# Build System TODOs

Outstanding issues and improvements for the build system.

## ✅ High Priority - Security & Bugs (Completed)

### 1. ~~IP Spoofing Vulnerability~~ ✅ FIXED

**File:** `lib/middleware/oapi_auth.go`

**Issue:** The `isInternalVMRequest` function was reading the `X-Real-IP` header directly from the client request.

**Fix:** Changed to only use `r.RemoteAddr` as the authoritative source. Added security comment explaining why headers should not be trusted.

---

### 2. ~~Registry Token Scope Leakage~~ ✅ FIXED

**File:** `lib/middleware/oapi_auth.go`

**Issue:** Registry tokens could potentially be used on non-registry endpoints.

**Fix:** Both `JwtAuth` middleware and `OapiAuthenticationFunc` now reject tokens with registry-specific claims (`repos`, `scope`, `build_id`) when used for non-registry API authentication.

---

### 3. ~~Missing Read Deadline on Vsock~~ ✅ ALREADY FIXED

**File:** `lib/builds/manager.go`

**Issue:** The `waitForResult` function blocked indefinitely on `decoder.Decode()`.

**Status:** Already implemented with goroutine pattern + connection close on context cancellation (lines 455-486).

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority - Implementation TODOs

### 4. ~~SSE Streaming Implementation~~ ✅ DONE

**Files:** `cmd/api/api/builds.go`, `lib/builds/manager.go`, `lib/builds/types.go`

**Status:** Implemented proper SSE streaming with:
- `BuildEvent` type with `log`, `status`, and `heartbeat` event types
- `StreamBuildEvents` method in Manager with real-time log tailing via `tail -f`
- Status subscription system for broadcasting status changes to SSE clients
- Heartbeat events every 30 seconds in follow mode
- `follow` query parameter support
- Unit tests for all streaming scenarios

---

### 5. ~~Build Secrets~~ ✅ DONE

**Files:** `lib/builds/manager.go`, `lib/builds/builder_agent/main.go`, `lib/builds/file_secret_provider.go`, `cmd/api/api/builds.go`

**Status:** Implemented secure secret injection via vsock:
- Host sends `host_ready` message when connected to builder agent
- Agent requests secrets with `get_secrets` message containing secret IDs
- Host responds with `secrets_response` containing secret values from `SecretProvider`
- Agent writes secrets to `/run/secrets/{id}` for BuildKit consumption
- `FileSecretProvider` reads secrets from a configurable directory
- Unit tests for `FileSecretProvider` with path traversal protection
- **Fixed vsock protocol deadlock** - agent now proactively sends `build_result` when complete
- Added `secrets` field to POST `/builds` API endpoint (JSON array of `{"id": "..."}` objects)
- E2E tested: builds complete successfully and logs stream via SSE

---

## 🟢 Low Priority - Improvements

### 6. ~~E2E Test Enhancement~~ ✅ DONE

**File:** `scripts/e2e-build-test.sh`

**Status:** Enhanced to run a VM with the built image after successful build. The test now:
- Creates an instance from the built image
- Waits for the instance to start
- Executes a test command inside the instance
- Cleans up the instance
- Use `--skip-run` flag to skip the VM test

### 7. ~~Build Manager Unit Tests~~ ✅ DONE

**File:** `lib/builds/manager_test.go`

**Status:** Added comprehensive unit tests with mocked dependencies:
- `TestCreateBuild_Success` - Happy path build creation
- `TestCreateBuild_WithBuildPolicy` - Build with custom policy
- `TestGetBuild_Found/NotFound` - Build retrieval
- `TestListBuilds_Empty/WithBuilds` - Listing builds
- `TestCancelBuild_*` - Cancel scenarios (queued, not found, completed)
- `TestGetBuildLogs_*` - Log retrieval
- `TestBuildQueue_ConcurrencyLimit` - Queue concurrency
- `TestUpdateStatus_*` - Status updates with errors
- `TestRegistryTokenGeneration` - Token generation verification
- `TestCreateBuild_MultipleConcurrent` - Concurrent build creation

### 8. Enable cgroups for BuildKit Secrets

**Issue:** When `--secret` flags are passed to BuildKit, runc requires cgroup mounts that aren't present in the microVM.

**Error:** `runc run failed: no cgroup mount found in mountinfo`

**Status:** The secrets API flow works correctly (host → vsock → agent → BuildKit flags), but BuildKit execution fails due to missing cgroups.

**Workaround:** Builds without secrets work fine. The secrets code is ready once cgroups are enabled.

#### Root Cause

The VM init (`lib/system/init/mount.go`) mounts `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/dev/pts`, `/dev/shm` but does NOT mount `/sys/fs/cgroup`. When BuildKit receives `--secret` flags, it uses runc which requires cgroups even for rootless execution.

#### Proposed Solutions

**Option A: Add cgroup mount to VM init (all VMs)**

File: `lib/system/init/mount.go`

```go
// In mountEssentials(), add:
if err := os.MkdirAll("/sys/fs/cgroup", 0755); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup: %w", err)
}
if err := syscall.Mount("cgroup2", "/sys/fs/cgroup", "cgroup2", 0, ""); err != nil {
    log.Info("mount", "cgroup2 failed (non-fatal)")
}

// In bindMountsToNewRoot(), add to mounts slice:
{"/sys/fs/cgroup", newroot + "/sys/fs/cgroup"},
```

Pros:
- Enables cgroups for all VM workloads
- Happens early in boot before user processes
- Properly bind-mounts to new root

Cons:
- All VMs get cgroup access (larger attack surface, though mitigated by VM isolation)

**Option B: Add cgroup mount in builder-agent only**

File: `lib/builds/builder_agent/main.go`

```go
func mountCgroups() error {
    if err := os.MkdirAll("/sys/fs/cgroup", 0755); err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return syscall.Mount("cgroup2", "/sys/fs/cgroup", "cgroup2", 0, "")
}
```

Pros:
- Only affects builder VMs
- Minimal scope

Cons:
- Late in boot (after chroot)
- May not work if /sys is read-only in newroot

#### Security Analysis

| Concern | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Container escape via cgroup | Very Low | VM hypervisor isolation + cgroup v2 (no release_agent) |
| Resource manipulation | Low | VM has hypervisor-level resource limits |
| Attack surface for user VMs | Medium | Consider making cgroups opt-in or read-only |

**Recommendation:** Option A with cgroup v2 is safe because:
1. VMs are already isolated by Cloud Hypervisor (hardware boundary)
2. Builder VMs are ephemeral (destroyed after each build)
3. Builder runs as unprivileged user (uid 1000)
4. Cgroup v2 has better security than v1 (no release_agent escape vector)

#### After Implementation

1. Rebuild init binary: `make init`
2. Rebuild initrd: `make initrd`
3. Test builds with secrets

### 9. Guest Agent on Builder VMs

**Suggestion:** Run the guest-agent on builder VMs to enable `exec` into failed builds for debugging.

### 10. Builder Image Tooling

**File:** `lib/builds/images/README.md`

**Suggestion:** Create a script or tooling for building and publishing new builder images.
