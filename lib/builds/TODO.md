# Build System TODOs

Outstanding issues and improvements for the build system.

## ✅ High Priority - Security & Bugs (Completed)

### 1. ~~IP Spoofing Vulnerability~~ ✅ FIXED

**File:** `lib/middleware/oapi_auth.go`

**Issue:** The `isInternalVMRequest` function was reading the `X-Real-IP` header directly from the client request.

**Fix:** Changed to only use `r.RemoteAddr` as the authoritative source. Added security comment explaining why headers should not be trusted.

---

### 2. ~~Registry Token Scope Leakage~~ ✅ FIXED

**File:** `lib/middleware/oapi_auth.go`

**Issue:** Registry tokens could potentially be used on non-registry endpoints.

**Fix:** Both `JwtAuth` middleware and `OapiAuthenticationFunc` now reject tokens with registry-specific claims (`repos`, `scope`, `build_id`) when used for non-registry API authentication.

---

### 3. ~~Missing Read Deadline on Vsock~~ ✅ ALREADY FIXED

**File:** `lib/builds/manager.go`

**Issue:** The `waitForResult` function blocked indefinitely on `decoder.Decode()`.

**Status:** Already implemented with goroutine pattern + connection close on context cancellation (lines 455-486).

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority - Implementation TODOs

### 4. SSE Streaming Implementation

**File:** `cmd/api/api/builds.go` (L227)

```go
// TODO: Implement proper SSE streaming with follow support and typed events
```

**Description:** The `/builds/{id}/events` endpoint should stream typed events (`LogEvent`, `BuildStatusEvent`) with proper SSE formatting, heartbeat events, and `follow` query parameter support.

---

### 5. Build Secrets

**File:** `lib/builds/builder_agent/main.go` (L239)

```go
// TODO: Implement bidirectional secret fetching
```

**Description:** Allow builds to securely fetch secrets (e.g., npm tokens, pip credentials) via the vsock channel during the build process.

---

## 🟢 Low Priority - Improvements

### 6. ~~E2E Test Enhancement~~ ✅ DONE

**File:** `scripts/e2e-build-test.sh`

**Status:** Enhanced to run a VM with the built image after successful build. The test now:
- Creates an instance from the built image
- Waits for the instance to start
- Executes a test command inside the instance
- Cleans up the instance
- Use `--skip-run` flag to skip the VM test

### 7. ~~Build Manager Unit Tests~~ ✅ DONE

**File:** `lib/builds/manager_test.go`

**Status:** Added comprehensive unit tests with mocked dependencies:
- `TestCreateBuild_Success` - Happy path build creation
- `TestCreateBuild_WithBuildPolicy` - Build with custom policy
- `TestGetBuild_Found/NotFound` - Build retrieval
- `TestListBuilds_Empty/WithBuilds` - Listing builds
- `TestCancelBuild_*` - Cancel scenarios (queued, not found, completed)
- `TestGetBuildLogs_*` - Log retrieval
- `TestBuildQueue_ConcurrencyLimit` - Queue concurrency
- `TestUpdateStatus_*` - Status updates with errors
- `TestRegistryTokenGeneration` - Token generation verification
- `TestCreateBuild_MultipleConcurrent` - Concurrent build creation

### 8. Guest Agent on Builder VMs

**Suggestion:** Run the guest-agent on builder VMs to enable `exec` into failed builds for debugging.

### 9. Builder Image Tooling

**File:** `lib/builds/images/README.md`

**Suggestion:** Create a script or tooling for building and publishing new builder images.
